## Description

A readMe is standard practice in code; it allows you to input important information or instructions regarding your repository making it accessible for others to see. This project is a node.js command line utility which essentially means it generates a template readme file to use for projects in your repository. The command-line allows you to navigate and easily create a readMe file as opposed to manually creating one on Github, thus making it time-efficient.

## Installation üõ†

<b>To install, follow the steps below:</b>

1. Ensure you have Node downloaded in your computer. To check if you already have it, in your terminal type:
   `node -v `

   This should print a version number, so you'll see something like this 'v0'. If can't see it, you can [click here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to download Node.
   <br>

2. Go on Github and create a new repository. Change the directory to where you want to store the repository using "cd" command.
   <br>
3. Using the "git clone" command, clone the repository into your local repository. It should look something like this: <br>
   <br>
   `git clone https://github.com/ayaneey/NodeJs.git`
   <br>
4. Now you need to install the required npm packages. Run `npm init` on your terminal. This will set up or intialise a new npm package. From here, you can start using commands that should generate your readMe file. To install all dependencies, then you need to run `npm install`.

## Usage

To invoke the command-line, in your terminal you will need to type:
`node index.js`
