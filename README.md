## Description

A readMe is standard practice in code; it allows you to input important information or instructions regarding your repository making it accessible for others to see. This project is a node.js command line utility which essentially means it generates a template readme file to use for projects in your repository. The command-line allows you to navigate and easily create a readMe file as opposed to manually creating one on Github, thus making it time-efficient.

## Installation

To install, follow the steps below:

1. Ensure you have Node downloaded in your computer. To check if you already have it, in your terminal type: node -v
   This should print a version number, so you'll see something like this v0 (If this is the case, please ignore step 1). If you do not have Node installed, follow this link:

2. Go on Github, create a new repository. Change directory to where you want to store the repository using "cd" command.

3. Using the "git clone" command, clone the repository into your local repository. It should look something like this:
   git clone https://github.com/ayaneey/NodeJs.git

4. Now you need to install the required npm packages using "npm install" in the terminal. Run 'npm init' on your terminal. This will set up or intialise a new npm package. From here, you can start using commands that should generate your readMe file.

## Usage

To invoke the command-line, in your terminal you will need to type:
node index.js
